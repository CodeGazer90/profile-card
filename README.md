### What I learned

This challenge had me sweating for a couple of days lol. The first challenge I did, I did use a lot of help from a youtube tutorial since I haven't coded in some months. I am proud to say that this one I did all on my own with the exception of getting the background images to stick when resizing the page. I could not have gotten that part done without the help of ApplePieGiraffe's solution. It was literally just one line of code that I needed but it made ALL of the difference. 

### Continued development

I will definitely have to learn the background-position: calc property. I actually attempted it prior to coming across that solution but I was not successful.
